# TellStick'R

This is a gem for communicating with the Telldus TellStick and TellStick Duo through the official telldus-core C library via Ruby.

It also includes device and sensor classes for easy communication via Ruby and Tellstick to your hardware.

If you didn't know, TellSticks are USB-stick radio frequency transmitters that plugs into your computer, and turns any computer into a wireless home automation center (switch on/off electronic devices, read values from various sensors).

So far version 2.1.0 of telldus-core library is supported.

If you would like to contribute to this code, you are more than welcome!

Happy hacking,
