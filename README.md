# TellStickR

This is a Gem for communicating with the Telldus TellStick and TellStick Duo through the official telldus-core C library in Ruby.

It also includes device and sensor helper classes for easy communication with various devices and sensors.

If you didn't know, TellSticks are USB radio frequency transmitters which turns any computer into a wireless home automation center (switch on/off electronic devices, read values from sensors, etc).

So far, version 2.1.0 of the telldus-core API is supported.

If you would like to contribute to this code, you are more than welcome to do so!
